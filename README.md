Originally I just erased my code after I was finished with practicing with it instead of saving it into a file..... 

I have had some minimal basic experience with coding before (Java) so I knew the basic concepts.
Most of my time was spent on coding the Ticket Project. 

(PRACTICING CONCEPTS)

I practiced using functions at first. 
Most of the practice with functions revolved around using for loops and user input.
The "Bottle of Beer" task helped with loops.

A concept that I had to practice also was error checking. Error checking became a huge part of the other Project, ticket Project, because I used error checking for a lot of things.
Mostly, I used error checking for user input. To make sure that the user doesn't input anything that would break the code.
I used the try, except method paired up with a while loop so that if the user does input something that is wrong, it would ask for the user's input again.

I also practiced with lists and nested for loops. I practiced this in my caesar cipher code. However I couldn't manage the caesar cipher to use negative numbers. I didn't know how. Maybe I could've found the absolute value then divide it by something.

Some tasks were a bit easy, like the Morse Code.
Dictionaries were new to me, but I really found it interesting.
I used it in this code
I just looped through the given string and used the .get() function.
I also used Dictionaries for my function selection/directory in the ticketing system project.
