Originally I just erased my code after I was finished with practicing with it instead of saving it into a file..... 

I have had some minimal basic experience with coding before (Java) so I knew the basic concepts.
Most of my time was spent on coding the Ticket Project. 

C
ODING CONCETPS

I practiced using functions at first. 
Most of the practice with functions revolved around using for loops and user input.
The "Bottle of Beer" task helped with loops.

A concept that I had to practice also was error checking. Error checking became a huge part of the other Project, ticket Project, because I used error checking for a lot of things.
Mostly, I used error checking for user input. To make sure that the user doesn't input anything that would break the code.
I used the try, except method paired up with a while loop so that if the user does input something that is wrong, it would ask for the user's input again.

I also practiced with lists and nested for loops. I practiced this in my caesar cipher code. However I couldn't manage the caesar cipher to use negative numbers. I didn't know how. Maybe I could've found the absolute value then divide it by something.

Some tasks were a bit easy, like the Morse Code.
Dictionaries were new to me, but I really found it interesting.
I used it in this code
I just looped through the given string and used the .get() function.
I also used Dictionaries for my function selection/directory in the ticketing system project.

Classes was another concept that I had to practice.
Ive learn't them before but I wasn't too confident.
I created some files where I just practiced making objects using classes.
Inheritance was easy to learn but coding it was mind-boggling.

Lastly I learnt about files. Opening files and closing files. I had a bit of troubles using variable names to open files instead of the actual file name. But that was just a naming error that I did.


PRINCIPALS AND ETC.

A design principal that I used quite alot was the agile methodology. I also used sprints for that.
I found sprints useful as I was able to break up a programme into separate chunks that does different things.
I found it easier to think like that.

For naming, I tended to use camelCase a lot. I was just used to that and I also found it easier to read.
I also used camelCase for my functions.
However for some cases, I did use other types of naming conventions.
For classes, the class name had a capital at the start.


I knew that some programmes will have a plethora of functions. It gets a bit overwhelming trying to make the code as simple as it can. However I did try to incorporate trying to make my code as simple as it can (KISS)
I mainly did this by planning my code little by little and grouping similar features together during my planning phase.

I found functions to be very useful as I didn't have to repeat my code.
There was a case in my ticketing project where I 4 different functions that all did the same thing at the start (get the ticket ID)
I then decided to simply take that bit and turn it into its own function. This way a function calls a function.
